# ARDUINO ROBOT -- OBSTACLE AVOIDING ROBOT

  This project can be found on youtube or Arduino Project Hub. Code had to be re-written as motors use a motor chip instead of the ADAFRUIT
motorshield.

1x Arduino Uno (NANO can be used instead but won't sit with the shield)

1x Motor Chip (could be optional)

1x ADAFRUIT Motorshield (can be done without, needs small screw)*

2x 3.7V 1.2mAh Batteries**

2x DC motors

1x Buzzer (optional/ can be done without)

1x Servo Motor

20x Jumper Cables

2x Standard wheels

1x Free-rotation wheel

1x Main body to assemble parts into (you can 3D print one of your liking)


*It's optional to use motorchip when using MotorShield, but it must be used if no Motorshield is used
** Could not find proper batteries? Amazon sells phone/camera batteries that could solder to wires


***When using motorshield, unless you plan to solder wires to the pins, use a small breadboard

****It is probable that this project would need a lot of soldering
